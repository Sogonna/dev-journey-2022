**Marketing Data Analysis – 2022**

In 2022 my interest in data and Python started to take a more serious turn.  
I Started to work with an Iranian online fashion brand as a marketing specialist, I began using Python to dig into the brand's real data — still at a beginner level, but with genuine focus on solving practical questions and making sense of numbers.

These scripts are exactly what I wrote back then: simple, early attempts that helped me learn how to turn raw data into something useful.  
They mark the beginning of seeing programming as a real tool for analysis and problem-solving.

### What's inside 

- **monthly-revenue-trend.py**  
  Aggregates daily sales into monthly totals and plots revenue trends to spot seasonal patterns and performance changes.

- **top-products-by-revenue.py**  
  Ranks products by total revenue and shows the top 10 performers in a bar chart to identify what’s driving income.

- **campaign-analysis.py**  
  Calculates ROI and ROAS for campaigns and channels, helping compare which marketing efforts were actually effective.

- **customer-roi-segmentation.py**  
  Applies RFM analysis to segment customers by recency, frequency and monetary value — one of my first attempts at understanding customer groups.

### Data Note

All datasets here are simulated but realistic recreations based on the actual marketing and sales data I worked with at the brand in 2022.  
Original records contain confidential customer and financial information, so synthetic versions were created to keep the same scale and patterns.

### Tools I used back then

- Python
- pandas & numpy
- matplotlib
